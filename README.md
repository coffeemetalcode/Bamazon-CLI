# Bamazon-CLI
A Command Line Amazon-like Shopping App

## Usage
node bamazonCustomer

Bamazon will display a list of Halloween-themed consumer goods, with pertinent information like product id, price and store department. Bamazon will then ask you to select a product.

Once you have chosen, Bamazon will ask you to specify a quantity. If there is sufficient quantity to fullfill your request, Bamazon will add the desired quantity to your shopping cart, calculate your total purchase price, and updates the product's inventory record in the database.

Otherwise, Bamazon will reply that there aren't enough on hand to fulfill your request.
